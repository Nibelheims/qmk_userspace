# Nibelheims' keymap
Meant for the rev1 lily58 with Elite-Pi controllers and OLED displays.
Use the default keymap with the following changes:
- OLED enabled
- VIA enabled
- NKRO enabled
- BOOTMAGIC_LITE enabled, on ESC and \`
- vertical content on left screen with WPM counter, layers, mod keys and caps lock status
- keylogger disabled, it's not fun having your passwords displayed...
- caps lock on lower-lshift
